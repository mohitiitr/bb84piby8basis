This ipython file hosts the bb84 quantum key distribution protocoal in two non conjugate basis.
BB84  is a key  distribution protocoal which tries to establish a secure key for communication over classical channel 
via the use of quantum channel.

The assumptions are that eves cannot modify the classical channel but 
can only tapin for collection of information exchange between alice and bob.

Bob declares the basis later to alice after he has recieved all the qubits 
and also has measured them on his arbitaraily chosed basis either computational or M basis.


Finaly as a measure of security they exchange the few bits of key to confirm that there is no eves dropping.
